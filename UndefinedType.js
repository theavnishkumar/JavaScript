// The undefined type has only one value: undefined. Itâ€™s the default value that all variables have after a declaration if no value is assigned to them. You can also assign the value undefined to any variable, but in general, this should be avoided, because if we need to mark a variable as not holding any meaningful value, we should use null.

let declaredVar;
console.log(typeof declaredVar);

declaredVar=5;
console.log(typeof declaredVar);

declaredVar=undefined;
console.log(typeof declaredVar);

//The undefined value can also be returned by the typeof operator when a non-existent variable is used as an argument.

console.log(typeof notDDeclaredVar);
//console.log(notDDeclaredVar); // Undefined error
