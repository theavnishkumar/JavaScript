// The last of the operators discussed is quite unusual, because it is the only operator using three operands. It is a conditional operator. Based on the value of the first operand (true or false), the value of the second or third operand, respectively, is returned. This operator is most often used to place one of the two values in the variable depending on a certain condition. We will come back to the operator when discussing the conditional if, but here weâ€™ll provide only a simple example of its use. The three operands are separated from each other by ? (the first from the second) and : (the second from the third).

console.log(true?"Alice":"Bob");
console.log(false?"Alice":"Bob");

let name=1>2?"Alice":"Bob";
console.log(name);
