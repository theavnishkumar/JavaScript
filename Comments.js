// Comments are just plain text, totally ignored by the javascript interpreter
// There are two types of comments
// 1. Single Line Comment 

let x=42;
// This is single-Line Comment 
console.log(x);

// 2. Multi-Line Comment 

let y=123;
/*
This is a block comment and it can span multiple lines

so this won't be executed
consloe.log(y);
*/
